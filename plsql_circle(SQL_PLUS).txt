EXPLANATION:

The code provided demonstrates how to use PL/SQL to calculate and insert the areas of circles based on different radii into a table. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. **Creating the Table:**
   ```sql
   SQL> create table circlearea(radius int, area int);
   ```
   - This SQL statement creates a table named `circlearea` with two columns: 
     - `radius` of type `int` to store the radius of the circle.
     - `area` of type `int` to store the calculated area of the circle.

2. **Querying the Table (Initially Empty):**
   ```sql
   SQL> select * from circlearea;
   ```
   - The query shows that the `circlearea` table is empty at this point since no data has been inserted yet.

3. **Editing the PL/SQL Script:**
   ```sql
   SQL> edit a1.sql
   ```
   - This command is used to open the `a1.sql` script in the editor. This is where the PL/SQL code to calculate and insert the circle areas will be written.

4. **PL/SQL Block Explanation:**
   ```sql
   declare
       r1 circlearea.radius%type;
       cir_area int;
       pi int;
   begin
       r1 := 5;
       pi := 3.14;
       for r1 in 5..9 loop
           cir_area := pi * (r1 * r1);
           insert into circlearea values(r1, cir_area);
       end loop;
   end;
   ```
   - **Declaration Section:**
     - `r1`: A variable to store the radius of the circle, which uses the type from the `radius` column in the `circlearea` table (`circlearea.radius%type` ensures it matches the column's datatype).
     - `cir_area`: A variable to store the calculated area of the circle.
     - `pi`: A constant variable used to store the value of π (approximately 3.14).

   - **Execution Section:**
     - `r1 := 5`: Initializes the radius variable `r1` with the value 5.
     - `pi := 3.14`: Assigns the value of π (3.14) to the variable `pi`.
     - `for r1 in 5..9 loop`: This loop iterates through the values of `r1` from 5 to 9 (inclusive).
       - `cir_area := pi * (r1 * r1)`: This line calculates the area of the circle using the formula **Area = π * radius²**.
       - `insert into circlearea values(r1, cir_area)`: This inserts the calculated `r1` (radius) and `cir_area` (calculated area) into the `circlearea` table for each value of `r1`.
     - `end loop;`: Marks the end of the loop.
     - `end;`: Marks the end of the PL/SQL block.

5. **Executing the Script:**
   ```sql
   SQL> @a1.sql
   ```
   - The `@a1.sql` command executes the PL/SQL block written in the `a1.sql` script. The loop calculates the area for radii from 5 to 9 and inserts these values into the `circlearea` table.

6. **Querying the Table After Execution:**
   ```sql
   SQL> select * from circlearea;
   ```
   - After executing the PL/SQL block, the `circlearea` table now contains the following data:
     ```
     RADIUS  AREA
     ------- -----
     5       75
     6       108
     7       147
     8       192
     9       243
     ```
     - These values correspond to the calculated areas of circles with radii 5 through 9 using the formula **Area = π * radius²** with π ≈ 3.14.

### Summary of Calculations:
- For radius 5: Area = 3.14 * (5 * 5) = 75
- For radius 6: Area = 3.14 * (6 * 6) = 108
- For radius 7: Area = 3.14 * (7 * 7) = 147
- For radius 8: Area = 3.14 * (8 * 8) = 192
- For radius 9: Area = 3.14 * (9 * 9) = 243

The script successfully inserted the calculated areas of circles with radii 5 to 9 into the table.
