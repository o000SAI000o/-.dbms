    { _id: 2, name: "Bob", position: "Designer", salary: 70000 },
    { _id: 3, name: "Charlie", position: "Manager", salary: 90000 },
    { _id: 4, name: "David", position: "Developer", salary: 85000 },

            totalSalary: { $sum: "$salary" }  // Summing up the Salary field
        }
    },
    {

    }
]);

EXPLANATION:

Here's a short and precise explanation of the code:

### 1. **Data Insertion**:
Inserts employee records into the `computer` collection in the `employee` database.

```javascript
use employee;

db.computer.insertMany([
    { _id: 1, name: "Alice", position: "Developer", salary: 80000 },
    { _id: 2, name: "Bob", position: "Designer", salary: 70000 },
    { _id: 3, name: "Charlie", position: "Manager", salary: 90000 },
    { _id: 4, name: "David", position: "Developer", salary: 85000 },
    { _id: 5, name: "Eva", position: "Analyst", salary: 75000 }
]);
```

### 2. **Map Function**:
Emits the total salary from each employee record.

```javascript
var mapFunction = function() {
    emit("total", this.salary);
};
```

### 3. **Reduce Function**:
Sums all emitted salary values.

```javascript
var reduceFunction = function(key, values) {
    return Array.sum(values);
};
```

### 4. **Aggregation**:
Groups by the fixed `"total"` key and sums up the `salary` field. The result is saved in `salary_totals`.

```javascript
db.computer.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: "total", totalSalary: { $sum: "$salary" } } },
    { $out: "salary_totals" }
]);
```

### 5. **View Results**:
Displays the total salary stored in `salary_totals`.

```javascript
db.salary_totals.find().pretty();
```

### Expected Output:
The `salary_totals` collection will contain the sum of all salaries, e.g., `{ "_id": "total", "totalSalary": 410000 }`.



concept:



The code demonstrates a **Map-Reduce** approach in MongoDB using the **Aggregation Framework**. Here's a breakdown of the core concepts behind it:

### 1. **Purpose of Map-Reduce**
   - Map-Reduce is a technique used to process large amounts of data by splitting tasks into two steps:
     - **Map**: Each document is transformed into key-value pairs.
     - **Reduce**: Values associated with the same key are processed together (e.g., summed).
   - In MongoDB, Map-Reduce can help perform operations such as **totaling** values, **averaging**, or **finding patterns** across large datasets.

### 2. **Map and Reduce Functions in MongoDB**
   - The `mapFunction` emits each document's `salary` under a common key `"total"`.
   - The `reduceFunction` takes all emitted salaries with the key `"total"` and aggregates them by summing them up. This reduces the array of salaries to a single total.

### 3. **Aggregation Framework vs. Traditional Map-Reduce**
   - MongoDB provides a more efficient and faster alternative to traditional Map-Reduce: the **Aggregation Framework**.
   - **Aggregation Pipeline**: The pipeline breaks down the process into sequential stages, each with a specific function:
     - **$group**: This stage groups all documents by the fixed key (`"total"`) and applies a calculation, in this case, summing the `salary` field.
     - **$out**: The result of the aggregation is stored in a new collection (`salary_totals`) for future queries.

### 4. **Efficiency and Flexibility of Aggregation Pipelines**
   - Aggregation pipelines are optimized for handling large data sets more efficiently than Map-Reduce.
   - They also provide flexibility to perform multiple transformations, making it easy to structure complex queries and data manipulations in a readable, sequential format.

### Concept Summary:
- **Map-Reduce Logic**: Breaks down data processing into a mapping (key-value pairing) phase and a reducing (combining values by key) phase.
- **Aggregation Pipeline**: A MongoDB-specific, optimized approach that can replicate Map-Reduce functions and perform multi-step data transformations.

### Output Interpretation:
After running the aggregation, the new collection `salary_totals` contains the total of all employee salaries, a useful result for understanding salary expenses across the company.
